â€¢	Blockchain technology, developed in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto for Bitcoin, is a decentralized and distributed ledger system that secures transactions without a central authority. Its adoption across various sectors has grown due to its security and reliability. Blockchain's decentralized nature eliminates single points of failure and enhances data protection. Once data is stored in a block, it cannot be changed without detection, ensuring transparency and trust. The technology's versatility enables peer-to-peer transactions, automation of processes, and tamper-proof record-keeping. As more sectors embrace blockchain, innovative solutions leveraging its versatility can create efficient, secure, and transparent systems.
