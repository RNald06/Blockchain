Blockchain technology was developed in 2008 by a person or group operating under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto to support its cryptocurrency known as "Bitcoin." It is a decentralized and distributed ledger system that uses cryptographic techniques to secure and validate bitcoin network transactions. Since then, numerous sectors have begun to adopt and recognize this technology as a new approach to protect and perform a safe transaction without a central authority's control.

The decentralized nature of blockchain technology is one of its most fundamental features. Being decentralized means that no single person or organization controls this technology, making it more secure and reliable for everyone. Also there is no single point of failure, making it superior to centralized systems where a single point of failure can result in asset and data losses.

Once a single block's data is stored in a blockchain, it is impossible to change or delete the block without being detected because it has become part of the entire network. Since any changes to the data in a block produces a different hash, which does not match the hash recorded in subsequent blocks, we know that each block in the blockchain contains a unique code called "hash," which is linked to the previous block and forms a chain. As a result, this attribute gives transparency, security, and trust in the blockchain data.

The versatility of blockchain technology is one of its primary features. Since it has a capacity to promote peer-to-peer transactions without the use of intermediaries, automate corporate processes, and establish tamper-proof records makes it suitable for a wide range of applications. As more sectors adopt blockchain technology, we may anticipate more inventive solutions that take advantage of the technology's versatility to develop more efficient, safe, and transparent systems.
